# Computer Vision (2023 Fall) - Prof. Min Sun

This repository contains the course assignments and final project for the **Computer Vision** course taught by **Prof. Min Sun** at NTHU.

## ðŸ”– Course Overview
This course covers classical and modern computer vision tasks including image filtering, 3D reconstruction, deep learning for visual recognition, domain adaptation, and pose estimation.

## ðŸ§  Assignments

### HW1 - Hybrid Images
Implemented image filtering and frequency-based hybrid image blending as described in the SIGGRAPH 2006 paper by Oliva et al.

### HW2 - Structure from Motion (SfM)
Built a basic SfM pipeline to recover camera poses and 3D structure from multiple views.

### HW3 - Big vs Small Models
Trained ResNet models from scratch and with pre-trained weights on CIFAR-10, analyzed performance vs model size and dataset scale.

### HW4 - Handling Domain Shift
Tackled domain adaptation challenges using YOLOv7 and discussed differences between classification and detection under domain shift.

## ðŸŽ® Final Project - Pose Estimation for Interactive Gaming
Used **Mediapipe Pose** to track full-body movements and control a game character in real-time.
